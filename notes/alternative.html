<summary>week8 chapter19 relative value hedge fund</summary>
<h3>Basic:</h3>
<p>Definition:??<br/>
Relative value fund managers take long and short positions that are relatively equal in size, volatility, and other risk exposures</p>
<p>The best known was LTCM</p>
<p>Four main types includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>convertible bond arbitrage</li>
<li>volatility arbitrage</li>
<li>fixed-income arbitrage</li>
<li>relative value multi-strategy funds</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>The classic convertible bond arbitrage trade is to purchase a convertible bond that is believed to be undervalued and to hedge its risk using a short position in the underlying equity.</li>
</ul>
<div style="overflow:auto;">
    $$\text{Convertible Bond Price} = \text{Value of Straight Corporate Debt} + \text{Value of the Implicit Equity Call Option}$$
    $$\text{Conversion Ratio} = \text{Number of Shares per Convertible Bond}$$
    $$\text{Option Strike Price} = \frac{\text{Convertible Bond Face Value}}{\text{Conversion Ratio}}$$
    $$\text{Conversion Value} = \text{Current Stock Price} \times \text{Conversion Ratio}$$
    $$\text{Conversion Premium} = \frac{(\text{Convertible Bond Price} - \text{Conversion Value})}{\text{Conversion Value}}$$
</div>
<p>Example:<br/>Consider a firm with a borrowing cost of 8% on unsecured, subordinated straight debt and a current stock price of $40. The firm may be able to issue three-year convertible bonds at an annual coupon rate of 4% by offering a conversion ratio such as 20.<br/>Given that a strike price of $50, and other parameters, such as volatility and dividends—is valued at $5.14 per share according to the Black-Scholes option pricing model.<br/>what are the value of the convertible bond, the conversion value, and the conversion premium?</p>
<p>Answer:<br/>Value of straight debt:40/1.08+...+1040/1.08^3=896.92<br/>Value of the implicit equity call option=5.14*20=102.8<br/>Convertible bond price=896.92+102.8=999.72</p>
<ul>
<li>Bonds with very high conversion premiums are often called <b>busted convertibles</b>, as the embedded stock options are far out-of-the-money. (<b>bond-like convertible</b>)</li>
<li>Bonds with very low conversion premiums have stock options that are deep in- the-money, where the convertible bond price and the conversion value are very close. (<b>equity-like convertible</b>)</li>
<li>Convertible bonds with moderately sized conversion ratios have stock options closer to being at-the- money and are called hybrid convertibles.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Delta, Gamma, and Theta</h3>
<div style="overflow:auto;">
<table>
<tr><td></td><th>Change of</th><th>Relative to</th></tr>
<tr><th>Delta \(\Delta\)</th><td>Value of Option</td><td>value of underlying assets</td></tr>
<tr><th>Gamma \(\Gamma\)</th><td>Delta</td><td>value of underlying assets</td></tr>
<tr><th>Theta \(\Theta\)<br/>(time decay)</th><td>Option price</td><td>Time</td></tr>
</table>
</div>
<ul>
<li>You can tell if an option is OTM by determining what the current price of the underlying is in relation to the strike price of that option. For a call option, if the underlying price is below the strike price, that option is OTM.<br/>These options will have a delta of less than 0.5</li>
<li>The lender of the securities earns interest on the collateral but typically offers the borrower of the securities a <b>rebate</b>.<br/>A <b>rebate</b> is a payment of interest to the securities’ borrower on the collateral posted.(借出方收证券的红利，返款rebate给借入方)</li>
<li><b>Payment-in-lieu</b> 借出方通过它回收借出的证券的利息</li>
<li><b>components of convertible arbitrage returns</b><br>Assuming a long position in the convertible bond and a short position in the stock.<br/>(Bond Interest - Stock Dividen + Short Stock Rebate - Financing Expenses) + Convertible Bond and Stock Net Capital Gain and Losses</li>
<li>Risks: Liquidity risk(private securities), Credit risk(downgraded or bankruptcy),....</li>

<summary>week9 Equity hedge fund</summary>
<p>Equity hedge funds follow the most popular hedge fund strategy, whether measured in terms of assets under management (AUM) or in terms of the number of funds.</p>
<h3>Types</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Equity long/short funds<br/>tend to have net positive systematic risk exposure from taking a net long position<br/><b>Example:</b>long:150%, short:80%, net long market exposure:70%</li>
<li>Equity market-neutral funds<br/>attempt to balance short and long positions, ideally matching the beta exposure</li>
<li>short-bias funds<br/>have larger short positions than long positions</li>
</ul>
<h3>Source of return (Equity Hedge Fund)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Providing liquidity</li>
<li>providing information efficiency</li>
<li>identifying company profit opportunities</li>
</ul>
<h3>Providing liquidity</h3>
<p>Liquidity in this context is the extent to which transactions can be executed with minimal disruption to prices.<br/>
Many hedge fund managers <b>provide liquidity</b> by searching markets to detect price movements that appear to be driven by orders that are large relative to existing liquidity<br/>
Providing liquidity refers to the placement of limit orders or other actions that increase the number of shares available to be bought or sold near the current best bid and offer prices</p>
<h3>Providing information efficiency</h3>
<p>Abnormal profit opportunities tend to come from market inefficiencies, and market inefficiencies tend to come from reduced competition.<br/>Another potential source of abnormal profits for hedge funds is overreacting/ underreacting</p>
<h3>Identifying the factor that could create profit opportunities</h3>
<p>Some equity hedge fund managers analyze the factors that drive the equity returns of each company in search of those that offer the ability to predict the equities that offer ex ante alpha.<br/>
Single factor model: CAPM(注：CAPM不是基于因子模型。。。)<br/>
Fama and French (1993): three-factor model</p>
<h3>Market Anomalies</h3>
<p><b>Investment strategies</b> that can be identified based on available information and that offer higher expected returns after adjustment for risk are known as <b>market anomalies</b>, and they are violations of informational market efficiency.</p>
<li>Some observed anomalies in market efficiency</li>
<ol>
<li>Accounting accruals(is the recognition of a value based on anticipation of a transaction)</li>
<li>Price momentum</li>
<li>Earning momentum</li>
<li>Net stock issuance(Prior studies show that firms with positive net stock issuance (i.e. stock issues) have lower future stock returns)</li>
<li>Insider trading(Insider trading can be illegal or legal depending on when the insider makes the trade, Legal insider trading happens when directors of the company purchase or sell shares, but they disclose their transactions legally.)</li>
</ol>

<h3>Law of active management</h3>
<p>The <b>breadth</b> of a strategy is the number of independent active bets placed into an active portfolio.</p>
<ul>
<li>A <b>bet</b> is simply a position in a security that is established because the security is perceived to be mispriced.</li>
<li>Independent refers to the statistical lack of correlation between the bets.</li>
<li>Active refers to the relatively short-term nature of the perceived return advantage.</li>

<summary>week10 chapter22 private equity</summary>
<h3>Basics:</h3>
<p>Defination (CAIA):<br/>The private equity sector purchases the private stock or equity- linked securities of nonpublic companies that are expected to go public or provides the capital for public companies (or their divisions) that may wish to go private</p>
<p>Characters:<br/>illiquid (not liquid), long-term</p>
<p>Strategies:</p>
<ol>
<li>Venture capital<br/>the financing of start-up companies</li>
<li>Leveraged buyouts (LBOs)<br/>established public companies are converted into private companies</li>
<li>Mezzanine financing<br/>a hybrid of private debt and equity financing.</li>
<li>Distressed debt investing<br/>investments in established (as opposed to start-up) but troubled companies</li>
</ol>
<p>Notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Buyouts are distinguished from mergers by the extent to which the firm that is bought out is intended to function as a stand-alone business rather than to be folded into the organization of the purchaser</li><li>
Typically, mezzanine financing is constructed as an intermediate-term bond, with some form of equity kicker thrown in as an additional enticement to the investor.</li><li>
An equity kicker is an option for some type of equity participation in the firm (e.g., options to buy shares of common stock) that is packaged with a debt financing transaction.</li><li>
The equity kicker portion provides the investor with an interest in the upside of the company, whereas the debt component provides a steady payment stream</li><li>
    distressed has two meanings. 1. the issuer of the debt is troubled. 2. distressed refers to the price of the bonds</li><li>
Hedge fund sometimes invest in distressed debt for short term: short distressed securities, long distressed firm, conduct structure arbitrage</li>

<li>Mezzanine financing<br/>Mezzanine venture capital, or pre-IPO financing, is the last funding stage before a start-up company goes public or is sold to a strategic buyer.<br/>The mezzanine financing may be used to buy out earlier investors and pay for other costs incurred before going public.</li>
<li>IPO</li>
</ol>
<h3>Types of buyouts</h3>
<p><b>leveraged buyout (LBO)</b> is distinguished from a traditional investment by three primary aspects</p>
<ol>
<li>an LBO buys out control of the assets</li>
<li>an LBO uses leverage</li>
<li>an LBO itself is not publicly traded</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li><b>management buyout (MBO)</b>LBO, led by the target firm’s current management</li>
<li><b>management buy-in (MBI)</b>LBO, led by an outside management team.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Calculate MOIC</h3>

<p>You are now a PE Associate and you have to figure out the expected returns on an investment.
<br/>The company has revenue of $100 in Year 0, growing $10 every year. It has an EBITDA of $50 in Year 0, also growing at $10 every year.
<br/>We’re buying it at the end of Year 0 for 10x LTM EBITDA (EBITDA multiple=10x). The debt-to-equity ratio for the LBO acquisition will be 50:50.
<br/>Suppose D&A is expected to equal $10, Capital Expenditures are expected to equal $10 , and operating working capital (NWC) is expected to increase by $5 each year, staying constant through our investment period. Interest rate is 10% and tax rate is 40%.
<br/>We exit the investment in Year 5 at the same EBITDA multiple used as at entry, what’s the exit equity value, MOIC?
</p>
<p><b>Answer:</b>purchase price:10*50=500, debt=500*50/(50+50)=250, equity=250, EBITDA_5=100,sell price=100*10=1000, LFCF=10+16.5+22+28+34=110, exit quity value(Ending purchase price)=1000-250+110=860<br/>MOIC=860/250=3.4</p>
<h3>The Appeal of a Leveraged Buyout to Targets</h3>
<p>From the perspective of the target firm’s corporate management, the benefits to those who are retained can include the following</p>
<ul>
<li>The use of leverage where interest payments are tax deductible</li>
<li>Less scrutiny from public equity investors and regulators</li>
<li>Freedom from a distracted corporate parent</li>
<li>The potential of company management to become substantial equity holders and thereby benefit directly from building the business</li>
</ul>
<h3>LBO Exit Strategies</h3>
<ol>
<li>Sale to a strategic buyer</li>
<li>IPO</li>
<li>Another LBO: 用负债买股权</li>
<li>Straight financing: 公司用负债支付股权</li>
<li>Buyout-to-buyout deal</li>
</ol>
<h4>???Four Spillovers of Corporate Governance to the Public Market</h4>
<p>First, the strong governance principles that an LBO implements in its private firms should remain when those firms are taken public again
¤ Second, LBO transactions serve as a warning to the management team of other public companies
¤ Third, the incentive and monitoring schemes implemented by LBO firms for their portfolio companies provide guidance to managers and shareholders of other firms searching for more efficient governance methods.
¤ Last, help stop unnecessary and inefficient diversification of large corporations.</p>
